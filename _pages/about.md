title: "About Me"
---

I am an **Agricultural Engineering undergraduate Student** with strong academic interests in
**Environmental and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (E/GFD)**, focusing on the physics
of natural flows in the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial environments.

My interests lie in the **fundamental fluid mechanics** governing environmental systems,
including buoyancy-driven flows, stratified and rotating fluids, turbulence,
and transport of heat and scalars. I am particularly motivated by the use of
**theoretical analysis and numerical modeling** to understand environmental flows
relevant to climate, agriculture, and natural systems.

I aim to pursue **MSc and PhD training** in environmental or geophysical fluid dynamics,
applied mathematics, or closely related applied physics programs, with long-term
goals in **fundamental research and academia**.
